## Purpose

This website is intended to serve as a portfolio for my development brand "Drifting Dev". It is a showcase of my work as a developer and graphic designer. I hoped to give the viewer a good understanding of my personality and style as a developer without being over-reliant on text, instead using graphical content, design and UX elements to communicate. 

This site contains a stripped back about me page with links to a resume and a skills graph. A projects page that showcases and links some of my github repos. A blog page that contains five standalone blogs and a contact page with twitter, github, linked in and email links. 

## Functionality / Features 
  * **Stripped back page design:**
      
      I tried to create a site that only has a few, attention grabbing elements per page for the viewer to interact with. I didnt want to have a sidebar, footer and header detracting from the main content on each page itself. To this end, I've used a simple black header at holds the main logo and a hamburger menu dropdown element. 

      Each page itself has relatively centralized content that sits in their respective sections. I wanted the user to be able to focus on one thing at a time, rather than having several blocks of content competing for attention on the same amount of screen space.

      _The second "block" of content on the about me page_

  * **Dedicated dropdown menu for site navigation**

      I used a dedicated drop down menu to again help simplify the UX of the website. When the user presses the menu icon, a menu will drop down and hide whatever content is on the page and display 4 icons with names. Clicking the menu button again will smoothly transition back to the page.
