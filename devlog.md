  **Project Outline**

  *Aesthetic*
  
  My goal with this portfolio website is to create a fairly minimalistic site that uses few elements to great affect. My current ideas for acheiving this:
  * The use of common colour scheme throughout the whole site.
  * High contrast layout
  * Thoughtful usage of text, trying to minimize where possible.
  * Intergration of small, simple pixel art images throughout the site.
  * Uncluttered display, eg only one main drop down navbar and minimal elements per page.

  *Pages*
  
  * Title: The landing page is simply a display of the brand logo with the nav bar at the top of the page. Animation here could be effective. Perhaps the logo could drop in on load, and move slightly with time.


  * About Me: Should be a simple page, with a title, an image on one side and text on the other. This will contain a brief description about myself as a dev followed by a small description about my skills. The "Language Graph" of having skill levels for various languages seems nice.
  * Projects: A title and basic grid layout for each project that reveals more details on hover is all this page will be. Each project will have an image.
  * Blog: A title and stacking blog posts. Not sure yet if each post should open up on click or simply link to another page. I think opening up then shrinking down would be navigationally more functional, but much harder to code. Will revisit this.
  * Contact me: Super simple, 3 icons for git, linkedin and twitter respectively. Small amount of text, potentially an image included for desktop/sidetablet version.

  *Nav Experience*

  * I want the nav bar to be a little bit showy. When you select the Nav bar, it should drop down to fill the entire screen and display 4 rows on mobile or a 2x2 grid on desktop. Each option will have an icon, a title and a subtitle. On mobile, the icon and title are displayed, on the desktop, hovering over the icon will display the title and subtitle. 

    Initially I wanted to get quite fancy with this, with lots of expanding and closing, but I think I'll start here and add more later if it seems reasonable to do so.
